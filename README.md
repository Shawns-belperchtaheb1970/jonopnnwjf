Stumbling out of the theater, eyes adjusting to the garish outside light, I couldn't shake the messy whirlwind Until Dawn left clattering around my brain. I mean, wow. What just happened? Did I get hit with a psychological horror freight train or was that some cosmic joke? It’s like they took every teen horror trope, threw them in a blender, and served it on the rocks with a twist of insanity. Yeah, it was kind of like that. 

I’m still feeling the buzz in my fingers. Watching those young, idiotic twentysomethings stumble around in the snow was like yelling at the screen: Guys, haven’t you learned anything from horror movies? Don’t split up! But did they listen? Of course not. I’m surprised they didn’t start playing Monopoly by candlelight up there in that death-trap of a lodge. Seriously, who goes to a creepy, isolated cabin in the first place? Answer: people who want to become toast.

> That one scene with the psychopathic deer (or were they elk? Do I even know the difference?) was as insane as trying to debug a code at 3 AM. My brain was like, “Do deer form angry mobs? Is that a thing?” But I guess anything’s possible when you’re dealing with curses or spirits or whatever those Wendigo things were. 

And the characters, man. Like a weird high school reunion where everyone’s got their own dirty laundry and someone always turns up dead, right? Emily was that one friend who’s always on your last nerve, while Sam had that girl-next-door-who-barely-knows-she’s-the-MVP vibe. It’s like picking a favorite cat at the shelter: impossible, but you get attached and hope some psychopath doesn’t throw them off a cliff. Seriously, what did I just watch?

Python snippet for no reason:
```python
if cabin in woods:
    while not characters_dead:
        calls_for_help()
```

So now I’m here, sprawled on the couch, wondering if it’s socially acceptable to tell someone to download the movie just to watch the chaos unfold. Maybe tone down the crazy, just leave the sound of hysterical laughter echoing in the empty, imaginary auditorium of my mind. Until Dawn was... an experience. An exhausting, exhilarating, panic attack in a popcorn tub that leaves you questioning life choices. Watch the movie, they said. It'll be fun, they said. Sure, if pure panic and confusion are your fun.
